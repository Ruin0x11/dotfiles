Well, ya see it I'm sure you will know what it's about.

This is a Sun Microsystems theme made for the greatest window manager around,
WindowMaker. :)

Only optional image included is the tile (Pixmaps/Sun_tile.xpm), which I thought was a bit too much in the general look of the theme, but I included it in case anyone would like to use it.

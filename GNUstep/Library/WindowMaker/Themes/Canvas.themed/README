Window Maker Theme:	Canvas

Newstyle Theme (.themed for 0.50.0+)

Inspired by the Checker theme that comes with Window Maker. I really wanted to
try out some of the new styles of image handling, t*gradient is cool :) This
is one of the few themes I've actually finished without numerous changes. It
flowed like chis...

I have really become attatched to a few Gimp filters, Apply Canvas & Motion Blur
combined make a cool effect. I've used it on a few other themes as well as my
webpage, <PLUG> http://www.dct.com/~logan/ </PLUG> :P There are a few other
themes as well as some icons for Window Maker, or for whatever use in mind.

Enjoy,

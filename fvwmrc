# This Fvwm2 setup file provides the basic emacs-centered environment
# that I have found most comfortable on my standalone machine at home.
# Basically it gives me a big Emacs window at the left and a slightly
# smaller XTerm at the right, together with a clock and CPU monitor
# and a few buttons for accessing independent desktops.

# I've tried to write lots o1x4f comments because I will certainly forget
# most of the details of Fvwm2's syntax and semantics before long.

# My display screen is 1440 pixels wide and 900 high.

# First, make sure that Exec chooses zsh instead of bash:
ExecUseShell /bin/zsh

# Next, specify the paths for all icons (.xpm files) that I'm using:
# PixmapPath /usr/share/icons:/home/icons
ImagePath /home/nuko/Pictures/icons:/usr/share/icons/xpm
